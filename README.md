Repackaging attack is a very common type of attacks on Android devices. In such an attack, attackers modify a popular app downloaded from app markets, reverse engineer the app, add some malicious payloads, and then upload the modified app to app markets. Users can be easily fooled, because it is hard to notice the difference between the modified app and the original app. Once the modified apps are installed, the malicious code inside can conduct attacks, usually in the background.
